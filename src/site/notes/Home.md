A digital garden

A digital garden is a collection of interconnected notes and ideas that are constantly evolving and growing over time. It is a personal knowledge management system that allows individuals to capture, organize, and share their thoughts, insights, and experiences with others.

Unlike traditional note-taking methods, which tend to be linear and hierarchical, digital gardens are non-linear and encourage the exploration of ideas from multiple perspectives. They can be created using a variety of tools such as wikis, blogs, or even simple text editors.

Digital gardens can be used for personal development, learning, creativity, and collaboration. They provide a platform for individuals to reflect on their thoughts and experiences in a structured way while also allowing them to share their knowledge with others.

Overall, digital gardens are a powerful tool for anyone looking to cultivate their thinking skills and build a personal knowledge base that can be accessed and refined over time.
