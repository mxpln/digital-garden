React framework

React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of an application. It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to update the UI, making it faster and more efficient than traditional DOM manipulation methods. React can be used for building web applications, mobile applications, and even desktop applications through various frameworks and tools such as React Native and Electron. Its popularity has grown rapidly since its release in 2013 and it has become one of the most widely used front-end development frameworks today.
